<div class="project-section-title">Predictive Publishing</div>
<p>
The new predictive publishing feature in Adobe Social enabled social teams to deliver content that would best resonate with their audience. The tool makes engagement predictions and timing recommendations using advanced sentiment analysis and predictive text mining algorithms based on historic data around engagement, post time, and sentiment.

<p>
I worked with the Adobe Research Lab and the Data Sciences team to integrate the capability with the existing publishing workflows.
